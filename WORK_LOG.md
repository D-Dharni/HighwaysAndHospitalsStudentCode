I read some articles about them and how they work so I could understand what nodes and edges meant. First, I made the list to be n+1 terms so the index directly lines up with the city. Then, I learned about adjacency matrixes and how they work: you have a list of lists so the lists are the cities and their lists are the neighbors of that specific city. Then I went through and I updated the list accordingly by filling in the adjacency graph with the correct value from the 2d array cities. |

Then I have to call the BFS function. I worked on the BFS function by writing out all the pseudocode for it and I'm pretty sure it should work. |

Then I got rid of my old code since it was inefficient and took up too much memory and put in barebones pseudocode for the union find. |
| September 20 | 10:30-11:30 | Did heavy coding after a 30 minute break. First, I made an array of roots to keep track of what each city's root is and decided to index it so that the cities are 1 index down that way I did not have to deal with shifting later on or also potential index out of bound errors. I started the union find code and figured out that the key would be to merge the cities together based off of their roots and also to have a way to find the roots of nodes properly. Therefore, I spent time coding those two mechanisms out. Then, I wrote the path compression code in the section where you are trying to find a node's root because that is where having a shorter path to follow would make the algorithm more efficient. Then, I wrote the code for counting the clusters which would just be to check how many cities are its own root as each cluster has only one root. |

Once I ran my code, however, I ran into one major bug. I realized that my implementation of how I was finding the parent node wasn't working, I initially tried to do it recursively. I spent some time trying to debug it but couldn't figure out how to do it recursively so I decided to switch to doing it non recursively. Once I had figured that out my code worked fine but I realized that my the unionFind and findParentNode sections could be coded as separate functions to make the code more abstracted. Once I had that sorted out I was done. |
