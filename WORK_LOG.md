| September 14 | 2:30-4:00 | Did some initial setting up for the adjacency matrix. I read some articles about them and how they work so I could understand what nodes and edges meant. First, I made the list to be n+1 terms so the index directly lines up with the city. Then, I learned about adjacency matrixes and how they work: you have a list of lists so the lists are the cities and their lists are the neighbors of that specific city. Then I went through and I updated the list accordingly by filling in the adjacency graph with the correct value from the 2d array cities. |

Then I have to call the BFS function. I worked on the BFS function by writing out all the pseudocode for it and I'm pretty sure it should work. |
